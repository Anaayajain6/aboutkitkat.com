<h2>they have the best texture. On the outside, a KitKat has a smooth and silky layer of chocolate<br> that just effortlessly dissolves onto your taste buds.
Then once you get further into<br> this delicacy, you will hit three soft yet crunchy wafers that will bless your tongue with satisfaction until you need more.</h><br><br>

<h1>WHY IS KITKAT BETTER THAN OTHER CHOCOLATES?</h>
<hr size="6" width="60%" color="C0C0C0">
<h2> KitKats have some of the largest variety in the world for candy bars. Let’s start with size.<br>
 They come in at least 7 different sizes, which I would name, but that would take too long.<br>
 KitKats also come in different flavors; you will not believe this, but it is true; there are hundreds of KitKats flavors.<br> 
I know, right! These flavors go from Mint and Rasberry all the way to wasabi and soy sauce.<br> Before assuming the worst about these uncommon candy flavors,
 I’d try it before you judge it.<br> Most of these flavors are only sold in Japan and are extremely popular.<br>
 In Japan, they use KitKats as gifts because they resemble a good luck charm.<br></h><br><br>
